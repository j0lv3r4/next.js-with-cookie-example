## The idea behind the example

In this example, we authenticate users and store a token in a cookie. The example only shows how the user session works, keeping a user logged in between pages.

This example is backend agnostic and uses `isomorphic-fetch` to do the API calls.

We use a simple passwordless backend (https://with-cookie-api.now.sh) that logs the user in with their GitHub username.

Session is syncronized across tabs. This means if you logout once, your session gets logged out on all the windows. For this we use a HOC called `withAuthSync`.

We use a simple helper called `auth` to help to retrieve the token across pages when needed and redirecting the user if not token was found.
